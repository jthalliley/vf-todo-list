# vf-todo-list

These are Mac-specific instructions.  Most will also work on Linux.

## Prerequisites

1. Install gradle, e.g., `brew install gradle`
2. Install java 8.  You can get it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.

To run:

1. In one terminal window, do `./run.sh`
2. To run tests, wait until the server is up. You'll see something like this:
```
2016-10-10 14:12:33.905  INFO 23539 --- [           main] com.vf.todo.Application                  : Started Application in 7.566 seconds (JVM running for 8.043)
```
   then in another terminal window, do `./tests.sh`.  You'll have to examine by eye, but is straight forward.
